## About This Project

I implemented this project as part of a course offered by [ooloo.io](https://ooloo.io/). This course was designed to simulate a professional real-world development environment by providing design, user stories, and code review.

[Johannes](https://jkettmann.com/author/johannes/) at ooloo.io designed the project using [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/). He also provided user stories via [Asana](https://app.asana.com/) as would be done on an agile software development team. 

I took each story and implemented them based on my own knowledge of React, css and Javascript.  Then submitted a pull request after each task was complete. [Johannes](https://jkettmann.com/author/johannes/), a senior developer, thoroughly reviewed the code and provided thoughtful feedback and guidance.

The course was unique in that, instead of teaching someone how to code, it taught me how to code in a professional environment.  It's difficult to get this type of instruction in a teaching environment.  The following are some of the techniques I learned or strengthened: 

* **Code reviews**
* **Professional Git workflow with pull requests**
* **[Writing integration tests](https://dev.to/jkettmann/inside-a-dev-s-mind-refactoring-and-debugging-a-react-test-2jap)**
* **Creating pixel-perfect designs**
* **Working with styled components**
* **Writing custom hooks**
* **Debugging inside a browser**

Stack and package choices were left up to my discrection with some guidance from the course as long as I met the acceptance criteria and used React to implement the app.
